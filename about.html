                            	<h3>About Jenata Studio</h3>

                            	<p>As an online gallery, Jenata Studio (Jenata) has a unique vision of discovery and aesthetic taste., looking for recommended works of art from all over the world and bringing them into our life.

Jenata signs exclusive agency contract with artist to publish and sold under the name of Jenata Studio. Each work has its version number and the official collection certificate issued by our studio.

Everyone has different feelings about artistic works, so the same work has different values for us.

What factors determine the value of works in contemporary art? From which master? What kind of experience has been or the previous auction price?

Of course, the charm of the master, the position of works in art history, and the cultural attributes of the works are all very important components of artistic value.

However, the value recognition of artistic works can also be simpler - just from your unique feelings it brings to you.

Art is not supreme，everyone can enjoy art, that's human instinct, and is also the uniqueness of art.

Therefore, we have formulated the screening rules for artistic works, focusing on artistic expression itself, bringing you more works with visual tension and original .

All works are exclusively distributed by Jenata Studio under the authorization of the artist.Tort must be prosecuted！Some works do not have individual signatures. Signature or not, that depends on the artist's personal wishes.

Each painting has its own version number and unique genuine collection certificate. (The smaller the number of editions, the higher the relative value of individual works.)The last two digits of the edition number in the work certificate are the edition number positions.

Example of Version Number Interpretation:

JEA19MOP0101

It can be interpreted as a 2019 production,the production sequence is M. The title code of the work series is OP，The sequence of this work in the series is 01，The number of plates is 01，The total number of editions of this series of works on the work certificate is 99, so this work is the first edition of 99 editions.


How to find out if the painting is genuine：

1. Visit the official website to inquire about the work number.
    www.jenata.art

2. Please send photos of your works and certificates to us
    jenata@foxmail.com

The paintings produced by Jenata all adopt top-class art micro-spraying technology.Color Stability for 150 Years. Color accuracy has been calibrated by Pantone Color Card.

Supporting the Value of Original Art with Professional Technology!

Jenata will choose different types of professional art-grade paper according to the difference of works.

                                <p>We mounted IKEA standard frames for some paintings.</p>

                                <p>

The price of the frames are transparent (Available from IKEA's official website) therefore, we can focus on the quality of works and the artistic value to the greatest extent.

If you don't like IKEA picture frames, you can choose frameless paintings and we have prepared a pair of white gloves for mounting for you.
